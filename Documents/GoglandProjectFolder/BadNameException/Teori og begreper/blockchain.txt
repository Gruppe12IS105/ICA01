The first hash (calculated on “I like donuts”) is bigger than the target, thus it’s
not a valid proof of work. The second hash (calculated on “I like donutsca07ca”) is
smaller than the target, thus it’s a valid proof.

You can think of a target as the upper boundary of a range: if a number (a hash)
is lower than the boundary, it’s valid, and vice versa. Lowering the boundary will
result in fewer valid numbers, and thus, more difficult work required to find a valid one.
